====== TODOs

i guess i want to just fit a handful of firms. perhaps the current dow30. 

compustat - financials for US and Canadian firms. 
crsp - prices and volumes (nyse, amex, nasdaq)

Can I put together a mySQL again? Ivo? 

Figure out how to programmatically access wrds

========== Computstat & CRSP
	
Compustat monthly updates - index constituent history
	- just 2014-01 to 2014-08. this has s&p and dow. 
	- has co-tic, but is it the same ticker? can check manually, if needed, via company name. yes, i can check manually over at optionmetrics. 
	- gvkey (company key), id, gvkeyx (index key)	
	- Dataset List → Compustat (COMPM) → Index Constituent History (IDXCST_HIS)
	- accessed from crsp? Is Computstat not COMPUSTAT? 

NAMES_IX: index information (id = gvkeyx)

Let me see whether components of SPX 100 are all liquid enough? do a volume test. 


========== SAMPLE OPTIONMETRICS DATA

9/1/12 - 8/31/13 unless otherwise noted
which file from which should I pull the indicative table? 

msft volSurface
	- forward prices: need to add spot, rates, and dividend (just assume correct expectation of dividends)

zero curve, 1/1/96 - 8/31/13
	- this seems nicely organized. do a little pre-interpolation to the standard maturities. 
		
msft dividend history. start (94) - dec 31 2013. [when will this be useful?]
	- don't know what's adj_factor. amts go into future. 

msft prices
	- hmm, closing prices, shares outstanding, volume! 
	- for things like sic, just need once
	
msft optionPrices [UNDESIRABLE]
	- there is a LARGE number of options. Perhaps don't use it. 
	- it does tell me bid-offer spread, open interest, volume, etc, as well as last-traded date. so does tell me liquidity conditions. 

msft optionVolume [ONLY GIVE SMALL SENSE OF LIQUIDITY]
	- can only use as first-step screening. 
	- also only need total, which adds up volume of puts and calls. 
	
msft historicalVolatility [USELESS]
	- not useful. this is a really simple thing to loko at tho. 

msft standardizedOptions [USELESS - *atm* forward implied vol]
	- I'm a bit confused, are these all at the money? 
	- strike price useless. what is interpolated premium? 
	- days: 30	60	91	122	152	182	273	365
