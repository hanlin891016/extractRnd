Use R? 
	http://iangow.wordpress.com/2012/09/03/remote-wrds-sas-from-r/#

this might be a decent intro to wrds + SAS

wrds presentation: use SECID for optionmetrics. it also has cusip? 
	wrds-sec platform... there is a unique id map? 
	It seems the matching between optionmetrics, compustat, and crsp should be via cusips. Yes, cusip/isin/cik are usually best. 

Matching in WRDS:

Can search!!! http://wrds-web.wharton.upenn.edu/wrds/tools/company_search.cfm
	this gives ticker, cusip, gvkey, cik, naics, daterange, permco, etc... 
	the thing is i need to do it programmatically

wrds provide mapping using SAS: 
	I guess i'll have to learn SAS

======= Namefiles

COMPUSTAT
	+ NAMES
	seems same as below... don't know what is the difference
	+ NAMES_IX: gvkeyx! indic table about indices
		gvkeys: 3 = S&P500, 5 = dow jones, 8 = nasdaq
	+ NAMESD, NAMESM, NAMESQ (securities... D,M,Q should be just frequency)
	gvkey, company name, cusip, cik, tic (but is different)


OPTIONMETRICS
	security_name (SECNMD): cusip, ticker, sic... good enough! 
		too many observations to download manually... need to find programming solution
