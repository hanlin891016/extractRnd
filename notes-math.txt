Important - assuming structure in sdf will give rise to certain structure in returns. or will it, without assuming rational expectations? 

TODO

1. look for multivariate utilities. serrano course has some; also, utilities for consumption and leisure. or, can we get it in the ICAPM derivation? I believe so! 
- another common alternative seems to be cobb douglas type. returns are not complements, tho! 

2. need to derive that my multivariate CARA gives rise to factor model. 
- campbell has many papers on that i think. his book with lo may also do the job. 


i don't think mixtures work. student-t and skew-normals also don't seem to be worth looking into. 
- the key is, i need to get a girsanov with my sdf... (lovely e^{-x})
- all conjugate priors: http://andrewgelman.com/2009/09/11/a_compendium_of/

2. read up http://www.stata.com/meeting/chicago11/materials/chi11_baum.pdf, as well as other refs (https://environment.yale.edu/content/documents/00001637/Mixed-Estimation.pdf?1330699238)

A Time- Series Analysis of Representative Agent Models of Consumption and Leisure Choice under Uncertainty
  this paper did a cobb-douglas utility. it just reminds me... why can't i do additive log utility?

"This is due to the properties of the characteristic function of a multivariate normal."

+ this seems relevant - look at rotations of multivariate normals:
