=== immediate Qs

term structure of equity returns? take a look at equity yields paper. otherwise, best is just engle stuff. 

my method needs validation - validation that the subjective physical density has value. can compare with surveys, and what else? (buying/selling pressure?)

engle's paper discusses projection! 
"Earlier papers, such as Rubinstein (1976) and Brown and Gibbons (1985), derive conditions such that a pricing kernel that has the consumption growth rate as a state variable is equivalent to a pricing kernel that has the equity index return as a pricing kernel state variable."

Okay, I need to actually understand the multi-beta representation of SDF. and then projection should be simple. 
- cochrane also has stuff about testing
- mathwise: this might be for multivariate girsanov. in any case, LIBOR mkt model claims to use it: http://www.math.nyu.edu/faculty/goodman/teaching/StochCalc2012/notes/Week10.pdf

- i'm suspecting that the engle method can fit the term structure (so whole surface), which is a benefit. 

there are things not so dependent on method. like mode (for robustness)
- my method has to work for less liquid single names. can't assume many prices
- i may use volume data to pick the most liquid horizon

will need to both subtract out dividends, and also combine with current prices (to transform to return space)

= existing papers looking at expectations
Bliss and Panigirtzoglou (2004) - parameterizes the risk layer. Rosenberg and Engle (2002) does a fully dynamic model. 

Melick and Thomas (1997) - mixture of lognormals
Campa, Chang and Reider (1998) - several methods used
Gemmill and Saflekos (2000)

shumway: uses the inverse cdf transform
