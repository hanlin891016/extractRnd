jeff said there were ideas thrown around (jules?) about using multiple stocks to look at dividend strips

=== refs

chabi-yo, garcia, renault 08 (could be quite relevant)
- the puzzle may be due to latent states. perhaps the math developed there can be used. 

christoffersen, heston, jacobs 09 (not very related)
- a statistical, two-factor model for volatility smirk (slope and level move separately)

bliss panigirtzoglou 05, use the reverse-cdf-method to estiamte implied risk aversion coefficients

chaudhuri schroder 09
- invented a test of monotonicity of SDF. found empirical evidence of monotonicity for individual stocks, but not SPX. 

beare schmidt 11
- another empirical test. also rejected monotonicity. 

bakshi chabi-yo 13
- jfe 13. lower bound of variance of perm vs. trans component of sdfs. comes from alvarez jermann 05, and is more general than hansen-jagannathan. 

bakashi madan panayotov 10
- found support for a u-shaped pricing kernel

ziegler 07 
- basically says that all existing proposed explanations do not seem to do the trick. somewhat related to ivo's paper? 

polkovnichenko zhao 13
- proposed an explanation based on rank-dependent utility and probability-weighting-bias.
