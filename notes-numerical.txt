Don't look at too many things. Just need to: 

1. merge data with relevant prices, dividends, perhaps some characteristics, etc (optionmetrics may have some). risk-free rate. 
2. fit a normal (also record mode) to each strip of option surface. Log return space. 

=== CODE: port matlab to R

main: mainFunction...m

completeTailsV2.m
fromQ2P.m	(this sounds like ross?)
interpolateSmile.m
gridSearch.m

volsurface2rnPrices.m
vol2price.m
setprod.m, splinefit.m, sound like utility functions


====== DATA

+ berkeley options: (1976 - 1996)
https://afs.stanford.edu/?path=/afs/ir/data/gsb/bod/

designed to access via unix, need to read unix tarfile
organized by date in 1996. before then... not as detailed. there are perl scripts (e.g. in 1991/implied.pl) that seem to do stuff to it

====== FUTURE

- should use quarterly options. p21 in figlewski '08

- figlewski used raw option prices. and took into account bid-offer spreads. perhaps take a look, but vol surface should be good enough for my purposes? 

- fitting either skewed normal dist, or mixture? can't make mixture weird tho. eric renault has a slide on that: Skew-Normal distribution ( Azzalini, 1985)
  - here are some refs: http://www.ivw.unisg.ch/~/media/internet/content/dateien/instituteundcenters/ivw/wps/wp122.pdf
  - recent proposal: http://www.mcgill.ca/files/economics/asymmetric_t.pdf
  - estimation seems weird difficult tho. there seems to be a method of moments estimation for skewness, but what abt the other two parameters? 
  - skewed generalized student t seems to do the job for both skewness and kurtosis? 

=== METHOD: figlewski 2008

he completes tails using generalized extreme value. i can probably do something more parametric, like some generalized lognormal. 

1. smooth the implied vol surface (steve = fourth order splie + ATM knot. i think optionmetrics already did it. perhaps add penalty term to double derivatives, to make things smoother)
- deal with put-call differences. bliss did vega-weighting. steve? 
2. get corresponding call prices, do double derivative to get pdf. cite Breeden and Litzenberger (1978) 
3. complete tails (less important for me)
